-- (a) The database has one club from the city named Copenhagen. How many clubs are
-- from the city named London?
-- (b) In the signedwith table, there are three di↵erent clubID values that no longer exist
-- in the clubs table. How many players signed with those clubs?
-- (c) The club named Liverpool has a total of 243 away wins, while the highest number
-- of away wins by any club happens to be 260. How many di↵erent clubs jointly have
-- the most away wins?
-- (d) During the playing career of Andrea Pirlo, he was involved with 319 home goals. As
-- outlined above, this means that while he was signed with di↵erent clubs, they scored
-- a total of 319 home goals. How many away goals was Steven Gerrard involved with?
-- (e) During his illustrious playing career, Bjorn signed with 7 di↵erent clubs. Write a
-- query to output the name(s) of the player(s) who signed with the largest number of
-- di↵erent clubs.
-- Note: The output of this query is a set of one or more player names.
-- (f) How many players never signed with a club from the city named London?
-- (g) London clubs are defined here as clubs from the city named London. All 14 non-
-- London clubs have beaten all London clubs away (meaning that the London club
-- was the home team) during some season registered in the database. How many
-- non-London clubs have beaten all London clubs away in a single season?
-- Note: This is a division query; points will only be awarded if division is attempted.
-- (h) Given the points rule in the database description, write a query that correctly outputs
-- the final standings (team names and total points, in descending order of total points)
-- for the season with ID = 2035. The figure below shows the first five lines of the final
-- standings for the season with ID = 2044.
-- Note: The output of this query
-- contains 20 rows of text. Do
-- not worry about formatting.
